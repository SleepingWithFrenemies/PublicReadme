Kudos to LaurieWired for her Original Sin of Computing video for introducing "obfuscated trojanized Quine compiler" idea and nomenclature. Nothing will be the same, especially after the videos on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language. Truly and new frontier is being plotted, should make for some good B-movie plots. Yes, you need to assemble assembly language and compile compilers. In order to understand recursion you must first understand recursion. 
This is just random note take for a future publication/autobiography/gravestone.
